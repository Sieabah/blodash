## Want to contribute?

Follow these rules

1. Try to reimplement the features creatively, make sure whatever interface is callback based and promises
are never anywhere near your solution
2. It must never throw an exception unless under very specific documented instances
3. Take the guesswork out meaningless names, people shouldn't be able to reason without going to a website for it.

## Making a PR

Just make one with great features fully tested.
